ASTRONOMICAL MODELS OF AL-BITRUJI

The "KITAB FIL HAY'AH"   كتاب في الهيئة is the only one manuscript left by al-Bitruji. He tempted to describe alternative astronomical models to the ptolemean ones.
Bernard R. Goldstein studied the manuscripts of this book and translated it into English.
After having transcripted the arabic manuscript in our modern writing, I developped Javascript codes and Geogebra instructions that help getting insight into the astronomical models of al-Bitruji and to see the output as trajectories on the screen.

You will find here the following programs and codes :

## FixedStars 
    01 - AlBitruji FixedStars Precession.html  // simulation of the movement of the vernal point (gamma Γ or γ)
## Sun
    02 - Simple Ecliptic.html // is not part of al-Bitruji model but serves as a reference to compare with
    03 - AlBitruji Sun without equant.html // simple model for the sun
    04 - AlBitruji Sun with Equant.ggb // a set of GeoGebra instructions, a more complicated model for the sun using the excentric and equant techniques
## Other planets
    All the next models use a deferent, an epicycle  and the  movement of completion called (isti-fa')
